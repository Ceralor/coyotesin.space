Hi! I specialize in retexturing models for plush or realistic latex, whether seamless or assembled! I haven't done any vinyl pooltoys yet but I'm willing to give it a try! 

[TOC]

# Pricing

| Option                                               | Price   |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Avatar Color+Texture (inc. 2 clothing item recolors) | $75-125 |
| 3+ clothing item recolors (total)                    | +$25    |
| Additional Avatar Styles (same character design)     | +$50-75 |

Commissions start at $75 USD for the retexture, ranging up to $125 maximum depending upon the complexity of your character and the avatar I'm working on (eg, winged characters are automatically $100-125 due to the added work involved). This price also includes recoloring and retexturing (eg, fabric ➡️ latex) work of up to 2 garments. Arm and leg warmers are considered separate garments for this policy. Additional garment recoloring and retexturing can be included for a total additional cost of $25.

Garments added to the Unity project, but not recolored, or with very minor recoloring, are included free of charge.

Additional character styles (plush, latex, etc) may also be included but will add $50+ per style as much of the work involved has to be re-done to account for the style difference. These are not included in the all-in tier.

Additional graphic or animation options may also cost extra depending on the work involved. Some of these I can do quite simply and others require a fair bit more planning, such as adding AudioLink-reactive zones to your avatar or clothes.

Alternate forms that significantly change coloration and appearances will cost as much as the base cost. Additional clothing costs won't be needed if using the same avatar base and clothing colors.

# Terms of Service

In order to make things work out well between us, I want to set a few ground rules to protect me and protect you in case of disputes or issues.

- Will/Won't Rules
    - I greatly enjoy doing the following, as they are my specialties:
        - realistic latex (glued/assembled creatures)
        - toony latex (usually seamless, simpler)
        - plush (fabric and fluff with stitching)
    - I cannot offering the following at this time:
        - Detailed animations, eg dances
        - Most mesh edits or custom mesh
        - fully-custom avatars
    - I will not draw, create, or depict the following:
        - Sexual activities of minors
        - Scat/Bathroom Play
        - Destructive shaders that impact other players' experiences
        - A character outside your own
            - With exception for gifts, in which case I will request the recipient's contact details as well to send a link to the assets *when* you are ready for me to send them.
        - Gore or death
    - I will not upload your avatar for you under my own account for you to utilize if you cannot presently upload one, but I may be able to help you rank up to allow uploads.
    The above are non-exhaustive lists of each and may be ammended as I find additional entries for each.
- Commission Definition
   Unless otherwise discussed, a commission from me for a retexture of a model consists of the following:
    - Complete recoloring of all associated body material slots of the specified 3D model including:
        - Patterns, markings, and coloration of the body, hair, and attached body structures (excluding clothing that is included in the mesh)
        - Normal/height maps for the above material slots, a non-exhaustive list including:
            - fur texture
            - fabric texture
            - latex or vinyl or fabric creases/wrinkles
            - overlap seams on latex or vinyl or stitching on plush
            - raised surfaces such as glued-on or stitched-on markings
        - Metallic/gloss maps for shiny surfaces, metallic surfaces, and specular that covers the texture behavior such as polish or semi-gloss surfaces
        - in the format for the current version of Poiyomi Shader unless otherwise requested
    - Recoloring and retexturing of up to 2 garments included, with more at an additional charge
        - Minor coloration adjustments of existing assets are included, eg. changing the arm color from grey to blue or red for glasses
        - Any number of unmodified assets may be included in the below-defined Unity scene
    - A Unity package containing any non-base required assets including:
        - the above-designated texture image files
        - Unity materials including said textures
        - A Unity scene for the PC avatar model including:
            - Materials attached to a prefab of the model
            - Requested clothes including recolors attached as appropriate in the hierarchy
            - Additional accessories either attached in the hierarchy or in a root 'offload' container
        - NOT containing:
            - Any base assets such as avatar bases, especially those that must be paid for by the commissioner
            - Shader dependencies such as Poiyomi (unless otherwise requested)
            - SDK dependencies such as VR Chat SDK
            - Additional packages such as Thry's Performance Tools or avatar conversion packages (eg VRM, CVR)
            - Source files for commissioned image assets such as Substance Painter files or Affinity/Photoshop documents
    - Separately accessed from the UnityPackage to save on download size, source files for commissioned image assets such as Substance Painter files or Affinity/Photoshop documents
    - Fixes for any discovered issues or glitches in the behavior of the material including coloring issues or missed blemishes, described further below
    - The above-described work for a single 3D avatar model and a single coloration design
        - This excludes commissions that have an added cost included for additional coloration designs
        - Coloration designs are defined as significant changes in coloration and/or color patterns for additional appearances, eg alternate forms
        - A single avatar does not include the clothing for it as this is often a separate mesh
        - Quest variants of avatars may be available and may incur an additional complexity charge or be included in the add-on textures package
- Payments and Refunds
    - Commissions will require discussion and partial payment up-front. After discussing the details of your commission, I will give you a total amount of the commission and send an invoice for either half of the total or the full amount, dependent upon your choice.
    - Discussions will also include whether or not your commission can or will be live-streamed, both dependent on the content and on your choice. 
        - If streamed, I may work on multiple commissioner's textures during the course of the stream without completing the avatar work on-stream. Much of the arrangement technicalities are fairly boring to watch, but it will be addressed during my next working session.
    - A full refund on the amount paid is available up to beginning work. After work has begun, a partial refund can be issued dependent upon the amount of work performed. After at least one hour of work, the refund will be deducted 25% of the total cost of the commission. For example, a $100 commission refunded after beginning work would have a $25 refund if half of the commission was paid and $75 if the full amount was paid.
    - All payments will be collected via invoices, whether in PayPal or another platform. No alternative payment methods will be accepted, eg gift cards, game codes, cryptocurrency, etc.
    - If a partial payment is taken up-front, the project and package files will not be released to you until paid in full.
    - In addition to receiving access to the source files, for most avatars I can supply a 'read me' file with steps to follow to upload the avatar, and support on the process should you run into any issues.

# Available Avatar Bases

Currently, I can texture the following avatars without an added fee for base acquisition. Please note you must own a copy of the base yourself -- project files I create will _not_ include the requisite base assets, only materials and scenes and overrides that depend on the originals. Avatars by the same maker in a category will be grouped, and additional assets specific to any avatar will be listed directly underneath them.
