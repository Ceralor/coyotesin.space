More updates on the project! :thumbs_up_paw: This site now has more [Mutant Standard](https://mutant.tech) emoji in use, and now uses a [spritesheet](/emoji_map/emoji.png) for the emoji, after some help from [Jaeson](https://jaesond.cc). This also allows me to be far more screenreader-friendly, accessibility oriented, not relying on images and alt text, instead using a span with 0.1px font size to hide the emoji name, also invisible color set, but still inside the &lt;i&gt; tag used to create the image.

It's not perfect yet, I'd love for it to be more configurable, but it does its job for me for now, and mostly just requires manual work on my part in the theme to make sure the CSS file generated is accepted.
