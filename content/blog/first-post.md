Oh, hey.

I guess I should start up a simple blog thing here as part of my site, heh! I've been wanting to make a nice simple site more than just my <a class="link" href="https://coyotesin.space">regular homepage</a>, so here we are.

I'm also going to see if I can't autopost to my Blimpstodon account whenever I post a new article, per like, RSS-feed updates. :ceralor_smile: Maybe. Or just manually.
