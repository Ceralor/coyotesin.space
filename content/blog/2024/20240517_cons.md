And getting bigger. This is just a short post, but I'm struggling with the size of the cons expanding.

But even still, I find myself wanting to engage more and more with some of the events I pass on like dances and the like. I wanna have fun at those, and just...vibe.

Anyway, my thoughts are much longer and this post'll get updated but I'm tired.
