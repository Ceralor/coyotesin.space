An unusual post this time! I've been thinking about the background for Kay, both as a fursona and a character, and figured that there's a LOT of attributes a regular refsheet type thing wouldn't cover. So, I'm putting together a page for it here on the site! I'll probably play around with formatting a great deal but, hope folks like. 

One thing that I'd like help with is a good way to format the miscellaneous information this page has!

[Check out the page here!](/sundry.html)

<section class="accordions">
  <article class="accordion">
    <div class="accordion-header toggle">
      <p>Also playing with spoilers...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-body">
      <div class="accordion-content">
        I've added a new bulma extension, for accordion support. Gonna use for spoilers. So much for no javascript, but CSS-based ones are a bit funky, maybe. We'll see!
      </div>
    </div>
  </article>
</section>

I'm glad you can embed HTML in Markdown articles in pelican and it'll play nice, at least.
